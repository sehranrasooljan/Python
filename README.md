# Python Learning in 17 Days

Welcome to the Python Learning in 17 Days repository!

This repository is designed to guide you through the fundamentals of Python programming in just 17 days. Each day corresponds to a specific Python concept or skill, and we provide a dedicated script for each day's learning.

## How to Use

1. **Choose Your Day:** Select the day you want to focus on. We've organized the learning materials in a day-wise manner.

2. **Google Colab Integration:** All scripts are compatible with Google Colab. Simply open Google Colab, upload the script for the respective day, and wait a couple of seconds for it to load.

3. **Boom! Start Learning:** Once the script is loaded, you're ready to dive into the world of Python programming. Explore the code, run it, and see the magic happen!

## Repository Structure

- Each day has a dedicated Python script, clearly labeled and annotated for easy understanding.
- Concepts build on each other, providing a structured learning path.

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute by improving existing scripts, adding new days, or suggesting better explanations. Open source thrives on collaboration!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
